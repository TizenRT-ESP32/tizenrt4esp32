# How to add TASH command

There are two methods to register TASH command, using public APIs and using built-in functionality.  
Please use one among them.

## Using Public APIs

Please find it at [README](../apps/shell/README.md#how-to-register-a-command-on-tash) of shell.

## Using Built-in Functionality

Please find it at [README](../apps/builtin/README.md) of built-in.  
But limitation of built-in is working it only in apps folder.
