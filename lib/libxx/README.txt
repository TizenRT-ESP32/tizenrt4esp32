libxx/README.txt
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This directory contains a fragmentary C++ library that will allow
to build only the simplest of C++ applications.  In the deeply
embedded world, that is probably all that is necessary.  If you
have a need for more extensive C++ support, the following libraries
are recommended:

 - libstdc++  (part of GCC)
 - STLport    http://www.stlport.org/
 - uClibc++   http://cxx.uclibc.org/
 - uSTL       http://ustl.sourceforge.net/
