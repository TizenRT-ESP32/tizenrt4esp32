 * Function:  pthread_condattr_setclock
 *
 * Description:
 *   Operations on condition variable attributes
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   attr
 *        A pointer to the pthread_condattr_t object for which you want to
 *        set the clock.
 *   clock_id
 *        A clockid_t object that specifies the ID of the clock that you want
 *        to use for the condition variable; one of:CLOCK_REALTIME
 *
 * Return Value:
 *   0 on successful. Appropriate error value otherwise.
 *
 * Assumptions:
