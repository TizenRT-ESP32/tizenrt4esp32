# The IoTivity project

IoTivity is an open source software framework enabling seamless
device-to-device connectivity to address the emerging needs of the
Internet of Things.

The project is described on https://iotivity.org and
https://wiki.iotivity.org.

The IoTivity project is licensed under the 
[Apache 2.0 license](LICENSE.md).

Components used by the project are described in 
[NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md).

To become a contributor, start by reading
https://www.iotivity.org/get-involved which describes project governance,
contribution guidelines and obtaining an account.

The master git location for IoTivity projects is gated by an instance of
the [Gerrit reviewing system](https://gerrit.iotivity.org),
such that pushing a change in git is intercepted by Gerrit
and presented as a review page.  The process of setting up
and using Gerrit for IoTivity is documented in a pair of
wiki pages:
  
* https://wiki.iotivity.org/how_to_use_gerrit
* https://wiki.iotivity.org/submitting_to_gerrit 

The issue tracker for the project lives at https://jira.iotivity.org.

**Note**: if you are reading this file from a source other than the
[official repository](https://gerrit.iotivity.org/gerrit/gitweb?p=iotivity.git;a=summary),
for example on the Github mirror,
please be aware that work happens relative to the official location. For
example, github pull requests and issue filings are very unlikely to be
acted upon, or even seen, by project participants.
