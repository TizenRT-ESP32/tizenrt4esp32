/**
 * An event group is a collection of bits to which an application can assign a
 * meaning.  For example, an application may create an event group to convey
 * the status of various CAN bus related events in which bit 0 might mean "A CAN
 * message has been received and is ready for processing", bit 1 might mean "The
 * application has queued a message that is ready for sending onto the CAN
 * network", and bit 2 might mean "It is time to send a SYNC message onto the
 * CAN network" etc.  A task can then test the bit values to see which events
 * are active, and optionally enter the Blocked state to wait for a specified
 * bit or a group of specified bits to be active.  To continue the CAN bus
 * example, a CAN controlling task can enter the Blocked state (and therefore
 * not consume any processing time) until either bit 0, bit 1 or bit 2 are
 * active, at which time the bit that was actually active would inform the task
 * which action it had to take (process a received message, send a message, or
 * send a SYNC).
 *
 * The event groups implementation contains intelligence to avoid race
 * conditions that would otherwise occur were an application to use a simple
 * variable for the same purpose.  This is particularly important with respect
 * to when a bit within an event group is to be cleared, and when bits have to
 * be set and then tested atomically - as is the case where event groups are
 * used to create a synchronisation point between multiple tasks (a
 * 'rendezvous').
