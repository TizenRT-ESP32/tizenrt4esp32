 * Name: fstat
 *
 * Description:
 *   The fstat() function will obtain information about an open file
 *   associated with the file descriptor 'fd', and will write it to the area
 *   pointed to by 'buf'.
 *
 *   The 'buf' argument is a pointer to a stat structure, as defined in
 *   <sys/stat.h>, into which information is placed concerning the file.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   fd  - The file descriptor associated with the open file of interest
 *   buf - The caller provide location in which to return information about
 *         the open file.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned. Otherwise, -1 shall be
 *   returned and errno set to indicate the error.
 *
